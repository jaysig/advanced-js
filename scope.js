//Where to look for things

//Undeclared - unable to find LHS (left hand side) references to a variable

//function declaration - function - first thing in the statement

//Function expression - var name = function 
	//Always want a named function expression ie var name = function nameHandler(){}
		//Helps with Debugging

//lexical scope - Going up elevator floors
	//cheated with eval
