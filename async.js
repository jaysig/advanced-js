/* Callbacks
	Callbacks sucks when there are multiple things needing to fire at once
	Callback Hell: 
	Inversion of Control: Handling over control of program to an API or something outside the program
	Seperate Callbacks: Success and failure callbacks - Does not fix it
	Error First: If, Else - Does not fix it
